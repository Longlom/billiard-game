# Simple billiard game using HTML5 + TypeScript

## Start project

1) `nvm use`

2) `npm i && npm run start`

## Mechanics
1) When a ball hits a hole, the hit ball count increases.
2) When the cue ball is hit into a hole, it is placed back at its initial position.
3) If all balls are in the holes, all buttons except "Restart" are disabled.
